# Cylon.js For LightBlue Bean

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics, physical computing, and the Internet of Things.

This module provides an adaptor and driver for the [LightBlue Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean/) from Punch Through Design. The implementation uses the [bean-serial](https://github.com/monteslu/bean-serial) node module from [@monteslu](https://github.com/monteslu/), which in turn uses the [ble-bean](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/ble-bean) node module from [@jacobrosenthal](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/). Thank you both very much!
